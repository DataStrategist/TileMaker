# TileMaker
An R script that enables the creation of data tiles for inclusion in a html dashboard or some such.

## Now available as a package!
To install, please type:
```
devtools::install_github("mexindian/TileMaker")
```

Please see the [Intro vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStrategist/TileMaker/master/Vignette.html) to learn more about how to do some lovely stuff, but in the meantime, here's the basics:

This package is intended to "highlight single values", mainly in dashboards, reports or Shiny apps, and is highly customizeable. This is what it looks like:

```{r}
library(TileMaker)
a <- solo_box(value = 3, txt = "Little piggies<br>go to the market", icon = "piggy-bank")
b <- solo_gradient_box(value = 65, txt = "test score I got")
c <- solo_gradient_box(value = 95, txt = "test score I wanted")
d <- multi_box(values = c(4, 5, 6), txt = c("Sally", "George", "Mohammed"), icons = c("check", "plus", "calendar"), title = "Candidates")

library(dplyr,quietly = TRUE)
library(htmltools)
e <- iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(a = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  tile_matrix(values = a, txt = Species)
f <- iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(a = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  mutate(old_a = c(3, 4, 5)) %>%
  tile_matrix(values = a, txt = Species, former = old_a)
d1 <- div_maker(span(a, b))
# d2 <- div_maker(e)
# d3 <- div_maker(f)

finisher(
  title = "Important Reportings", css = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  file = NULL, textModifier = "h1", d1, d1
)
```
